## Idea

An embedding of undirected graphs is a morphism `f : G → H` of undirected graphs
which is an embedding on vertices such that for each unordered pair `p` of
vertices in `G` the map

```text
  edge-hom-Undirected-Graph G H :
    edge-Undirected-Graph G p →
    edge-Undirected-Graph H (unordered-pair-vertices-hom-Undirected-Graph G H f)
```

is also an embedding. Embeddings of undirected graphs correspond to undirected
subgraphs.
