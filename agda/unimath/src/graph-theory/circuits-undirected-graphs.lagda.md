## Idea

A circuit in an undirected graph `G` consists of a `k`-gon `H` equipped with a
totally faithful morphism of graphs from `H` to `G`. In other words, a circuit
is a closed walk with no repeated edges.

## Definition

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (k : ℕ) (G : Undirected-Graph l1 l2)
  where

  circuit-Undirected-Graph : UU (lsuc lzero ⊔ l1 ⊔ l2)
  circuit-Undirected-Graph =
    Σ ( Polygon k)
      ( λ H →
        totally-faithful-hom-Undirected-Graph (undirected-graph-Polygon k H) G)
```
