## Idea

A cycle in an undirected graph `G` consists of a `k`-gon `H` equipped with an
embedding of graphs from `H` into `G`.

## Definition

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (k : ℕ) (G : Undirected-Graph l1 l2)
  where

  cycle-Undirected-Graph : UU (lsuc lzero ⊔ l1 ⊔ l2)
  cycle-Undirected-Graph =
    Σ (Polygon k) (λ H → emb-Undirected-Graph (undirected-graph-Polygon k H) G)
```
