## Idea

A complete undirected graph is a complete multipartite graph in which every
block has exactly one vertex. In other words, it is an undirected graph in which
every vertex is connected to every other vertex.

There are many ways of presenting complete undirected graphs. For example, the
type of edges in a complete undirected graph is a 2-element subtype of the type
of its vertices.

## Definition

```agda
complete-Undirected-Graph-𝔽 : {l : Level} → 𝔽 l → Undirected-Graph-𝔽 l l
complete-Undirected-Graph-𝔽 X =
  complete-multipartite-Undirected-Graph-𝔽 X (λ x → unit-𝔽)
