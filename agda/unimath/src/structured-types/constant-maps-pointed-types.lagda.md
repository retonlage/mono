## Idea

Given a type `X` and a pointed type `A`, the constant map from `X` to `A` maps
every element of `X` to the base point of `A`.

## Definition

```agda
const-Pointed-Type :
  {l1 l2 : Level} (X : UU l1) (A : Pointed-Type l2) → X → type-Pointed-Type A
const-Pointed-Type X A x = point-Pointed-Type A

pointed-const-Pointed-Type :
  {l1 l2 : Level} (A : Pointed-Type l1) (B : Pointed-Type l2) → A →∗ B
pr1 (pointed-const-Pointed-Type A B) =
  const-Pointed-Type (type-Pointed-Type A) B
pr2 (pointed-const-Pointed-Type A B) = refl
