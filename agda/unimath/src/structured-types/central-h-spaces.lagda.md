## Idea

In [`structured-types.coherent-h-spaces`](structured-types.coherent-h-spaces.md)
we saw that the type of coherent H-space structures on a pointed type `A` is
equivalently described as the type of pointed sections of the pointed evaluation
map `(A → A) →∗ A`. If the type `A` is connected, then the section maps to the
connected component of `(A ≃ A)` at the identity equivalence. An evaluative
H-space is a pointed type such that the map `ev_pt : (A ≃ A)_{(id)} → A` is an
equivalence.

## Definition

```agda
is-central-h-space :
  {l : Level} (A : Pointed-Type l) → UU l
is-central-h-space A =
  is-equiv
    { A = type-Pointed-Type A → type-Pointed-Type A}
    ( ev-point-Pointed-Type A)
```
