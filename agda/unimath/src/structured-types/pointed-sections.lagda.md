## Idea

A **pointed section** of a pointed map `f : A →∗ B` consists of a pointed map
`g : B →∗ A` equipped with a pointed homotopy `H : (f ∘∗ g) ~∗ id`.

```agda
pointed-section-Pointed-Type :
  {l1 l2 : Level} (A : Pointed-Type l1) (B : Pointed-Type l2) →
  (A →∗ B) → UU (l1 ⊔ l2)
pointed-section-Pointed-Type A B f =
  Σ ( B →∗ A)
    ( λ g → (f ∘∗ g) ~∗ id-pointed-map)
```
