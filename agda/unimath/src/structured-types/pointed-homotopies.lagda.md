## Idea

A pointed homotopy between pointed dependent functions is a pointed dependent
function of the pointed family of pointwise identifications. Since pointed
homotopies are defined for pointed dependent functions, a pointed homotopy
between pointed homotopies is just an instance of a pointed homotopy.

## Definition

```agda

## Properties

### Pointed homotopies are equivalent to identifications of pointed maps

  pr1 refl-htpy-pointed-map = refl-htpy
  pr2 refl-htpy-pointed-map = inv (right-inv (preserves-point-pointed-map f))

  htpy-pointed-map : (g : A →∗ B) → UU (l1 ⊔ l2)
  htpy-pointed-map = htpy-pointed-Π f

  extensionality-pointed-map : (g : A →∗ B) → Id f g ≃ (htpy-pointed-map g)
  extensionality-pointed-map = extensionality-pointed-Π f

  eq-htpy-pointed-map : (g : A →∗ B) → (htpy-pointed-map g) → Id f g
  eq-htpy-pointed-map g = map-inv-equiv (extensionality-pointed-map g)
