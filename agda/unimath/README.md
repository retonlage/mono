The `agda-unimath` library is a community formalization project for univalent
mathematics in [Agda](https://github.com/agda/agda). The library project was
created by Elisabeth Bonnevier, Jonathan Prieto-Cubides, and Egbert Rijke. Our
goal is to formalize an extensive curriculum of mathematics from the univalent
point of view. Furthermore, we think libraries of formalized mathematics have
the potential to be useful, and informative resources for mathematicians. Our
library is designed to work towards this goal, and we welcome contributions to
the library about any topic in mathematics.
