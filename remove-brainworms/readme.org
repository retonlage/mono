#+title: Readme

a firefox extension for removing the worst infohazard vectors from twitter.

in particular this extension can block:
 * the algorithmic feed
 * recommendation in the right sidebar
 * irrelevant stuff in the left sidebar
 * metrics counts on posts
 * notification other than replies (doesn't filter the notification count pt)

* tasks [0/4]
** TODO disable the notification icon for unwanted notifications
this probably requires looking into the actual dynamic state to see what kind of notifications we are dealing with from outside the notifications tab
** TODO configuration
** TODO gpt for detecting engagement bait
killer app that i am too lazy to implement
*** TODO key management
** TODO other interface languages
interface string are hardcoded in the filters. hooking into twitter localization would be much better.
